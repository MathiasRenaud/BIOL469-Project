# Prokka Annotation Scripts

These scripts are derived from ../annotation.sh to split up the computational work to run on each of our machines.

This allowed us to complete our prokka annotations in 1 hour instead of 4.

To reproduce these scripts, the sequences must be put back into the 4 directories for each machine: seqs/mathias, etc.
To see exactly which genome sequences were run by each script, refer to the commit history.
